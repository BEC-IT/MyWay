"My Way" by Frank Sinatra

Verse 1:
And now the end is near
and so I face the final curtain
my friend...
    of which I'm certain
I';ve lived



Verse 2:
regrets I've had a few
but then again too few to mention

??byway

bridge:
yes there were times I've had a few
when I bit off more than I could chew


verse 3:
I've loved
I've laughed and cried
I've had my share my fill of loosing


??not in a shy way???


bridge:
but what is man
